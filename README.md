**Introduction**
------------------
A two wheeled balancing robot that i built from scratch, this repository contains all the 3d models and code used.


**Overview**
---------------
  The Two-Wheeled Balancing Robot is a simple yet fascinating project that explores the principles of dynamic balance in robotics. The robot uses sensors and actuators to maintain an upright position, mimicking the balance seen in many natural systems.

**Features**
------------------------
  Self-balancing mechanism
  Adjustable PID control for stability

**Hardware Requirements**
---------------------------
I used these components to build the two wheeled robot

  1. Arduino uno
  2. l298n motor driver
  3. 2 12v dc motor
  4. MPU-6050
  5. 3d-printer
  6. Battery
  7. breadboard
  8. srx580 reciever
  9. stx882 transmitter 
  10. 2 PDI-1181MG (unused in the current version)


Software Requirements
---------------------
Arduino IDE 
Required libraries (written in the code)
